        Outputs images of the maximum log likelihood model inferred by the model-fit. This function is called
        throughout the non-linear search at input intervals, and therefore provides on-the-fly visualization of how
        well the model-fit is going.

        The visualization performed by this function includes:

        - Images of the best-fit `Tracer`, including the images of each of its galaxies.

        - Images of the best-fit `FitInterferometer`, including the model-image, residuals and chi-squared of its fit
          to the imaging data.

        - The hyper-images of the model-fit showing how the galaxies are used to represent different galaxies in
          the dataset.

        - If hyper features are used to scale the noise, a `FitInterferometer` with these features turned off may be
          output, to indicate how much these features are altering the dataset.

        The images output by this function are customized using the file `config/visualize/plots.ini`.

        paths

            visualization, and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.

            via a non-linear search).
        during_analysis
            If True the visualization is being performed midway through the non-linear search before it is finished,
            which may change which images are output.
