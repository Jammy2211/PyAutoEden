        Class representing a galaxy, which is composed of attributes used for fitting hyper_galaxies (e.g. light profiles,         mass profiles, pixelizations, etc.).

        All *has_* methods retun `True` if galaxy has that attribute, `False` if not.

        Parameters
        ----------
        redshift
            The redshift of the galaxy.
        pixelization
            The pixelization of the galaxy used to reconstruct an observed image using an inversion.

        Attributes
        ----------
        adapt_model_image
            The best-fit model image to the observed image from a previous analysis
            search. This provides the total light attributed to each image pixel by the
            model.
        adapt_galaxy_image
            A model image of the galaxy (from light profiles or an inversion) from a
            previous analysis search.

        *contribution_factor* hyper_galaxies-parameter.

        This is computed by dividing that galaxy's flux by the total flux in that         pixel and then scaling by the maximum flux such that the contribution map         ranges between 0 and 1.
